<h2 align="center"> What is an evil twin attack? </h2>

An <b>evil twin</b> is a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point that appears to be legitimate but is set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications.                   
This type of attack may be used to steal the passwords of unsuspecting users, either by monitoring their connections or by phishing.

This project is the implementation of a simple tool for an evil twin type attack in the Python language.
In addition this project contains a defense tool which prevents this attack
